# Portfolio

This is just my personal portfolio to show my recent projects ( well notable ones at least ) and my litereture that I have written.

The theme was inspired by Cursor's Website because I love the minimalistic theme they have chosen. ( Me and Chatgpt tried our best to imitate the theme with my limited knowledge in typescript :< )
